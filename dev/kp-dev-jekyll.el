;;; kp-dev-jekyll --- jekyll configuration
;;; Commentary:

;; I am not auto-setting any files to this mode
;; because I want to use normal web/markdown
;; mode outside of jekyll. To use this mode in
;; your file do either of the following:
;;
;; M-x jekyll-markdown-mode
;; M-x jekyll-html-mode
;;
;; NOTE (05-03-2015):
;;   There are still bugs with with Polymode so dont
;;   be suprised to find issues with this.

;;; Code:

(require 'jekyll-modes)

(provide 'kp-dev-jekyll)

;;; kp-dev-jekyll.el ends here
